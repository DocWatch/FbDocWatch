# Product Overview

The Messenger Platform gives you the ability to have conversations with people
on Messenger. We've added new tools for you to build and promote your bot so
you can create a custom experience for your unique audience.

## Discovering Your Bot

Using plugins, codes and links people can discover your bot and start
conversations. Using Customer Matching, you can reach people on Messenger if
you have their phone number and they've agreed to be contacted by you.

### Web Plugins

We’ve created two new plugins you can drop onto your website that work on
desktop and mobile web. When people click the "Send to Messenger" plugin, you
can initiate a conversation with them in Messenger. The "Message Us" plugin
takes the person directly to Messenger and allows them to initiate a
conversation with you. On desktop, the person will be sent to messenger.com
and on mobile they'll be sent to the Messenger native app.

### Customer Matching

Customer matching allows you to reach people in Messenger if you have their
phone number and their consent to be contacted by you. In conversations on
Messenger, people will see you as a brand and not just a short code.
Conversations initiated through Customer Matching will be received as Message
Requests allowing people to be reached only by the bots they want to
communicate with.

## Having a Conversation

### Welcome Screen

If a person starts a new conversation with your bot, you can set expectations
with a welcome message and call-to-action to kickoff the experience. People
who click the "Message Us" plugin or find you through search will see your
welcome screen.

### Structured Templates

You can format your messages in a variety of ways. Send simple text and
images, or use our structured templates to customize your message bubbles.
Structured templates allow you to render an image, text and multiple buttons
in one message.

You can also render a carousel, allowing you to send a list of items in a
compact way. Use buttons to include a call-to-action, which can open a web
page or trigger a callback.

### User Controls

We’ve updated Messenger to provide people with even more ways to control the
conversation and make sure they can reach the businesses they care about.
